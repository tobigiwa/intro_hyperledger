# CALL-TO-NOTICE: The Blockchain Application We Ought to Know Instead: A Potential hope for Inter-Africa banking.

Alright, I can already hear you thinking, "What's this person blabbering about now? We're all acquainted with it, the revolutionary force that gave rise to Bitcoin, Ethereum and its other cousins plus siblings (siblings here are Tokens). Yes, the utilization of blockchain technology, or, if we're inclined to be more technical, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), which underpins the power of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency, that thing that was supposed to allow us to evade central authorities and now it feels more like another overhyped tech scam. You know how they say, "You never get a second chance to make a first impression" or "First Impression lasts Long".The majority of the ideas that no longer exist suffered that fate, and so did the underlying technology that powered cryptocurrency, the Blockchain - A Distributed ledger system.

The Blockchain is a decentralized network right, but here is something most people don't know, there are types of these Blockchains; Private, Public, Permissioned, Permissionless and some other classifications that are not needed here. Public blockchains allow anyone to participate, while private blockchains enforce membership, and only parties with a valid membership can participate in the blockchain. A permissionless blockchain has no central authority, and anyone can participate. They can read and write the blockchain. A permissioned blockchain requires a managing blockchain authority to enroll and grant membership to participate. The enrolled party may have rights to read-only, or write only, or read and write. **Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned private blockchain**.


Naturally, one might wonder, "Why is he introducing something called 'Hyperledger Fabric,' and why should we be concerned?" A valid inquiry indeed, for Hyperledger Fabric could potentially be the solution Africa needs to establish a self-reliant financial framework for inter-Africa banking. Allow me to acquaint you with this technology as defined by [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/hyperledger#rich-text-7adac80698), a major contributor to its development:

- > "Hyperledger Fabric is an open, proven, enterprise-grade, distributed ledger platform. It has advanced privacy controls so only the data you want shared gets shared among the “permissioned” (known) network participants."

This insight might start to resonate with my earlier statement, "A Potential Hope for Inter-Africa Banking." This very technology, Hyperledger Fabric, is key here. Now, let's redirect our attention from this technology and direct it toward Africa for a while. Africa contends with a multitude of challenges; however, I'd like to highlight two economic solutions that take precedence as essential:

> [Envisioning a borderless-trade in Africa](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wBLY_ih7Nkk)

> [An independant system of transaction](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-Pb0YCN82AM)

Embedded within the text above, you'll find YouTube shorts that vividly exemplify these solutions. I strongly encourage you to view them. If you've watched these videos, I'm confident you'll now find merit in the notion that these two solutions are pivotal for Africa's advancement. So, how does this particular blockchain application, Hyperledger Fabric, aid Africa? It hinges on African commercial banks joining forces to establish the envisioned "independent transaction system." And this is where Hyperledger Fabric takes center stage.

Here is why, going back to IBM quote on the technology: Hyperledger Fabric is:

> Open:
Hyperledger Fabric operates under the banner of open-source technology. What makes this truly remarkable is that it opens the door for all of us to engage with it. The codebase is readily accessible to everyone, fostering a collaborative community where a diverse array of contributors can actively shape its evolution.

> Proven: 
The technology's widespread adoption by prominent companies and nations attests to its robustness. A [simple exploration](https://www.google.com/search?q=companies+and+countries+already+using+hyperledger+fabric&sca_esv=560650153&sxsrf=AB5stBjqKx99pzvO37CGkGgsHthObkPObQ%3A1693218568105&ei=CHfsZKuNBofOgAbunoTYCQ&ved=0ahUKEwirsZ3akv-AAxUHJ8AKHW4PAZsQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=companies+and+countries+already+using+hyperledger+fabric&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiOGNvbXBhbmllcyBhbmQgY291bnRyaWVzIGFscmVhZHkgdXNpbmcgaHlwZXJsZWRnZXIgZmFicmljSABQAFgAcAB4AZABAJgBAKABAKoBALgBA8gBAPgBAeIDBBgAIEE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) into the companies and countries that have already embraced Hyperledger Fabric demonstrates its real-world impact. This extensive adoption stands as a testament to its reliability and adaptability to diverse use cases.


> Enterprise-grade:
Hyperledger Fabric stands as an exemplar of technology meticulously engineered to meet enterprise-grade standards. Its architecture is designed to accommodate the intricate requirements of businesses, enabling seamless scalability, secure transactions, and adherence to industry regulations. This focus on enterprise-level applicability ensures that it can effectively address the complex needs of the modern business landscape.


> Distributed ledger:
Central to Hyperledger Fabric's functionality is its foundation as a distributed ledger technology (DLT). This means that the ledger's record-keeping mechanism is decentralized and shared among network participants. In the context of Africa's vision, where inclusivity and accessibility are crucial, a distributed ledger ensures that every participant, from local entities to continental players, can engage and contribute to the shared ledger state.

> Privacy
The preservation of privacy is a cornerstone of any financial system, and Hyperledger Fabric acknowledges this imperative. The technology maintains advanced privacy controls, ensuring that only data authorized for sharing is accessible to the designated participants within the network. Banks, integral components of any financial ecosystem, require this assurance to sustain their operations.


If you're now pondering, "Why exactly bring Blockchain into this equation?" or questioning the motive behind this inclusion, let me elucidate: Blockchain addresses a paramount challenge that lies at the core of Africa's ambition to create a cooperative banking and monetary framework—a challenge that reverberates with the resounding word: trust. Think about it, how can you expect 54 diverse countries to unanimously agree on something as intricate as a monetary system or a common ledger system?. Imagine, for a moment, attempting to unify such a diverse ensemble of nations under a single financial regime. The inevitable clashes of interests and priorities can stall progress and imperil the venture's existence. Here's where Blockchain holds sway. It democratizes authority, affording every participant a say in the orchestration of actions. Consensus becomes paramount, functioning as the cornerstone upon which decisions are founded. Blockchain's distributed nature ensures that no single entity can dictate terms or monopolize power. Each party's input holds weight, fostering a collective endeavor where collaboration is key.

What am insinuating here, because I need to clarify that, is not a one-currency Africa, but that is not a bad idea, majority of the countries (if not all) in the Eurozone spends the Euro, so a one-currency Africa is no bad idea. But what i Hyperledger presents is not a new cryptocurrency, infact the HF is not built or intended to be built to support a coin or token. The idea is a ledger system,a distrubuted permsissioned system. With HF, africa can seat on the same table together auditing it transaction with the same ledger book.


Allow me to clarify my intention here, as it's essential to dispel any misunderstandings. What I'm conveying is not an advocacy for a singular currency across Africa, although that notion isn't without merit. Consider the Eurozone, where the majority, if not all, of the countries transact in Euros—an arrangement that showcases the viability of a unified currency. However, the essence of what Hyperledger Fabric (HF) offers goes beyond the realm of introducing a new cryptocurrency. In fact, HF isn't conceived or designed to support a distinct coin or token. The crux of the matter revolves around the establishment of a shared ledger system, a distributed and permissioned structure. With HF, Africa has the potential to unite around a common ledger, metaphorically sitting at a shared table where transactions are collectively audited using the same ledger book.

In this context, it's pivotal to underscore that the essence of Hyperledger Fabric transcends the creation of a novel digital currency. Rather, its core proposition revolves around the establishment of a robust and accessible ledger system that fosters cooperative endeavors. Unlike the concept of a unified currency, which holds both pros and cons, the emphasis here is on enabling a unified method of tracking, recording, and validating transactions. It's akin to the entire continent utilizing a shared accounting system, eliminating the disparities that can arise from diverse ledger practices.

The fundamental distinction lies in the fact that Hyperledger Fabric doesn't aim to mint a new coin; instead, it forges a path toward harmonizing record-keeping practices. This is a shared infrastructure that promotes transparency, accuracy, and collaboration. So, envision Africa's nations metaphorically convening around a single ledger, akin to the pages of a collective ledger book, to collectively ensure financial integrity and enhance trust in transactions.

By deploying Hyperledger Fabric, Africa's disparate financial entities can collaborate seamlessly, all while preserving their distinct currencies. It's about convergence without currency uniformity, fostering unity through shared oversight and accountability. This collaborative ledger is the conduit for Africa's nations to engage in mutual auditing, each contributing their piece to the larger puzzle. The result is a tangible expression of cooperation, a way to bridge differences and promote harmony in a complex financial landscape.
