# CALL-TO-NOTICE: The Blockchain Application We Ought to Know Instead: A Potential hope for Inter-Africa banking.

Alright, I can already hear you thinking, "What's this person blabbering about now? We're all acquainted with it, the revolutionary force that gave rise to Bitcoin, Ethereum and its other cousins plus siblings (siblings here are Tokens). Yes, the utilization of blockchain technology, or, if we're inclined to be more technical, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), which underpins the power of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency, that thing that was supposed to allow us to evade central authorities and now it feels more like another overhyped tech scam. You know how they say, "You never get a second chance to make a first impression" or "First Impression lasts Long".The majority of the ideas that no longer exist suffered that fate, and so did the underlying technology that powered cryptocurrency, the Blockchain - A Distributed ledger system.

The Blockchain is a decentralized network right, but here is something most people don't know, there are types of these Blockchains; Private, Public, Permissioned, Permissionless and some other classifications that are not needed here. Public blockchains allow anyone to participate, while private blockchains enforce membership, and only parties with a valid membership can participate in the blockchain. A permissionless blockchain has no central authority, and anyone can participate. They can read and write the blockchain. A permissioned blockchain requires a managing blockchain authority to enroll and grant membership to participate. The enrolled party may have rights to read-only, or write only, or read and write. **Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned private blockchain**.

Now, it going to be in your head, Why should I heck care about that, Allow me to show you what [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/hyperledger#rich-text-7adac80698) (a big player in contributing to the development) defines Hyperledger Fabric to be;

- > "Hyperledger Fabric is an open, proven, enterprise-grade, distributed ledger platform. It has advanced privacy controls so only the data you want shared gets shared among the “permissioned” (known) network participants."

This might begin to click on my second statement "A Potential Hope for Inter-Africa banking", this particular technology, the Hyperledger Fabric. Let me further talk about that statement, a hope for Africa as I see it. Africa is faced with many problems but as I have deduced we have **two most important economic solutions** that we should enact first;
